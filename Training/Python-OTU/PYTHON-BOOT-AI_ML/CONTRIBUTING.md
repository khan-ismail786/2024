## How to Contribute
 
1. Create your own fork of the code
 
2. Do the changes in your fork
 
3. Create pull request
* Be sure you have followed the [Coding Guide](./CodingGuide.md) for the project.
* Use descriptive Pull Request (PR) names
* If your PR is a Work in Progress (WIP) then prefix the title with "WIP-{descriptive feature name}
   * Use descriptive PR Names
     * ex/ "Sonar for Maven"
     * ex/ "Fortify for Maven"
   * If your PR is a WIP then prefix the title with "WIP-{descriptive feature name}"
     * ex/ "WIP-Sonar for Maven"
4.  A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one.
